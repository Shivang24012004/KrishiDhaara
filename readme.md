## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

KrishiDhaara follows a modular microservices architecture consisting of five key components:

1. **Web Client**: React-based responsive dashboard that provides visualization, control center, and user management
2. **Mobile App**: Kotlin-based Android application that enables on-field monitoring, control, and disease detection
3. **IoT Server**: Python-based middleware that handles sensor communications, data processing, and automation
4. **AI Server**: Specialized service for disease detection, anomaly detection, and intelligent data analysis
5. **Backend Server**: Core application logic, database management, and API gateway services

This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance across the platform.
